//! Process spawning logic
//!
//! Handles spawning new processes and capability setup.
//!
//! # Architecture: Init-Driven Spawn Protocol
//!
//! Per the architectural invariants, all process lifecycle management should
//! flow through Init (PID 1) to ensure proper audit logging via SysLog.
//!
//! ## Current Implementation (Transitional)
//!
//! The current `complete_spawn()` uses direct kernel calls for process
//! registration and endpoint creation. This is a **transitional** approach
//! while we build out the async Init-driven spawn infrastructure.
//!
//! Direct kernel calls are acceptable during this transition because:
//! - Kernel methods still log commits to Axiom
//! - The supervisor is a trusted boundary component
//!
//! ## Target Architecture (Init-Driven)
//!
//! The target flow routes all operations through Init:
//!
//! ```text
//! Web → Supervisor: spawn("terminal")
//! Supervisor → Init: MSG_SUPERVISOR_SPAWN_PROCESS
//! Init → Kernel: SYS_REGISTER_PROCESS (via Axiom)
//! Init → Supervisor: MSG_SUPERVISOR_SPAWN_RESPONSE(pid)
//! Supervisor: Start worker with PID
//! ```
//!
//! ## Bootstrap Exception
//!
//! Init itself (PID 1) is created via direct kernel calls during bootstrap.
//! This is the **only** allowed direct kernel call for process creation.
//! See `boot.rs` for the bootstrap documentation.
//!
//! # Spawn State Machine
//!
//! For proper spawn tracking and timeout handling, each spawn operation goes
//! through a state machine:
//!
//! ```text
//! Requested → WaitingForBinary → WaitingForPid → WaitingForEndpoint → WaitingForCaps → Ready
//!     ↓              ↓                  ↓               ↓                   ↓            ↓
//!  Timeout       Timeout           Timeout          Timeout             Timeout      Success
//!     ↓              ↓                  ↓               ↓                   ↓
//!  Failed         Failed            Failed          Failed              Failed
//! ```
